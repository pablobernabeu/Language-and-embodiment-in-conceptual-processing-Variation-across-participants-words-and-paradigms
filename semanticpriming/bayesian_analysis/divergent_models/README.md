In the semantic decision and lexical decision studies, a 'divergent_analysis' folder was

created to document the initial models that were run before achieving convergence. In 

the present, semantic priming study, no results are included in the current folder 

because the initial models were stopped when the initial semantic decision models 

finished and returned multiple convergence warnings. Due to the similarity between the

size of these models, it was inferred that the semantic priming models would produce 

convergence warnings too, and therefore the corresponding steps were taken; namely, 

the final model contained more post-warmup draws and contained random slopes for the 

effects of interest only, and not for any covariates (see Remedy 11 in Brauer & Curtin, 

2018; https://psych.wisc.edu/Brauer/BrauerLab/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Brauer-Curtin-2018-on-LMEMs.pdf).
