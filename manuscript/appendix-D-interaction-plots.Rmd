This appendix presents plots of interactions that did not fit in the main text. 


## Study 1: Semantic priming


```{r semanticpriming-interactions-with-gender, fig.cap = 'Interactions with gender in the semantic priming study.', out.height = '70%'}

# Run plot through source() rather than directly in this R Markdown document 
# to preserve the italicised text.

source('semanticpriming/frequentist_analysis/semanticpriming-interactions-with-gender.R', 
       local = TRUE)

  paste0(
    getwd(),  # Circumvent illegal characters in file path
